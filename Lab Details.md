    > **NOTE** In some cases, this can a significant amount of time depending on the workshop you are attending. For long setup times, you will received an email notification that your lab is ready

    ![Launch lab.](/media/web-main-page.png "click the Launch Lab link")

    > **NOTE** Both page layouts will inform you of the time remaining for your lab. It is important that you keep track of this as your lab will be de-provisioned at the end of this time.

7. In many cases you will start off with a Virtual Machine that is part of your lab environment. As you can see from the above screenshots, the login information will be presented to you. If you have a `Lab Guide` tab, then your credentials will be on the `Lab Environment` tab.

8. In the absence of a virtual machine you will likely use the provided credentials to simply login to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) where the necessary lab resources have been provisioned for you.

3. If appropriate, you can use this navigation window to copy/paste items from the lab documents into the virtual machine.

4. You are also free to browse open an RDP session directly to the virtual machine and browse directly to the Azure Portal and github hosting the labs to perform your labs if that is easier for you.
